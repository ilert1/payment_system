# PNP — Custom Payment Processing System

**PNP** is a fully custom and modular payment processing system designed to handle diverse and country-specific payment flows.  
The project is implemented using **React, TypeScript, SCSS modules, and Zustand**, and follows the **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)** architectural methodology.

PNP provides a scalable, multilingual, and analytics-ready frontend foundation for integrating various international payment methods.


## 📌 My Contribution in the project

I personally led and carried out the architectural redesign, the full migration from JavaScript to TypeScript, the implementation of the FSD architecture, and the development of the custom UI kit.
